            This game is about a spaceship flying through space destroying asteroids and
            aliens. This was a personal project that I wanted to create. The gameplay consists of the player 
            trying to reach the end of the level with the highest score by not crashing into the asteroids
            and aliens, and destroying the asteroids and aliens to increase their score. I was the sole devloper
            for the project. I used some assets from the unity asset store, for example, the alien spaceship and
            the asteroids and their textures. I programmed the gameplay mechanics. One notable feature is the 
            damage pop-ups when the player fires and hits one of the aliens or asteroids, which in turn, decrease 
            the visible health bars above the enemies.

            The game is in early development and but is in a playable state. The Gif on the right shows a level 
            in the game.
