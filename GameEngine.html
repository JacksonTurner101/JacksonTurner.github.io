        <p>This game engine was built with C# and uses OpenGL for graphics and
            OpenTK for input. The engine has multiple systems and managers
            including audio, collision, physics, and rendering systems, and entity, input,
             scene, and resource managers. Also, I made a game using the game engine.
            The game includes a maze were multiple planets are following
             the player and if they come into contact, the player loses a life.
            The player can shoot the planets and travel around the maze and 
             pickup multiple "power-ups" to help survive in the maze.

        <p>
            The structure of the game engine follows an Entity Component System (ECS) design pattern.
             This means that everything in the game is an entity, which is essentially a container for components.
            Components are simple data containers that store attributes or states, 
            such as position, velocity, or health. Systems are the logic that processes these components
            and perform actions based on the data that the compnents hold.
