        <img id="geGif" src="Gifs/PCG_Short.gif">
        <p>This project included making a terrain generator that creates procedually generated
            collidable terrain. The generator uses perlin noise for the terrain. There is a height
            map which determines the colour of the terrain based of the height. There is also a 
            falloff map which gradually lessens the impact of the terrain generator which makes islands
            instead of full worlds of terrain. In order to make the generator more efficient there is 
            also a level of distance setting which can determin how many vertices are used for the terrain.
            Higher vertices are used for terrain closer to the user and gradually less and less vertices are used.
        </p>
        <p>The procedural terrain generator can be edited to have the effect that the user desires. 
            There are options for the height multiplier making the points on the terrain higher or
            lower. There is an option to choose the number of octaves used in the calculation for the 
            perlin noise. More octaves means that there are more layers of the perlin noise used in the 
            calculation. With this comes the option to choose how much each octave affects the final perlin
            noise output. A high number of octaves with each octave having a big affect output terrain that
            is much more jagged and as a result looks a lot more natural and random looking.
