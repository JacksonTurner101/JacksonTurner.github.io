            <p class="font-size-to-window-size">This project included using the CPU and GPU to create a particle simulation.
                Essentially, there is a spray can spraying paint particles onto a piece of paper.
                After the simulation has finished there is an output for the paper that the 
                spray can was aiming at. One simulation is on the CPU using the programming language
                Rust. There is another simulation on the GPU using CUDA. Both simulations output a
                BMP file which shows the paper of the execution of the particle simulations.

                <div class="font-size-to-window-size">In order to create this particle simulation that uses the GPU, 
                    I decided to use NVIDIA's parallel computing architecture, CUDA. This allowed me to write
                    kernels (functions that run on the GPU) enabling the use of thousands of threads to simulate the
                    particles efficiently in parallel.

                    piece of paper that the particles hit. The particles have a position where they start from and also have
                    a downwards velocity aiming towards the paper. The kernels move and detect if the particles hit the paper.
                    If the particles hit the paper, the place that the particles hit on the paper is colored red.

                <div class="font-size-to-window-size">For the particle simulation using the Rust programming language, I used a producer/consumer
                    design pattern. This means that the threads used can be a producer or consumer. A producer thread 
                    makes the data for the consumer thread to use. I used the producer/consumer design pattern
                    for firstly creating the particles and assigning them their values like position, velocity and 
                    if they had collided with the paper. This would be an example of a producer thread. Next, I used another 
                    thread for moving the particles. This thread would try to gain access of the particle, and if it
                    could, then it would move the particle and check for collisions, then release the particle. This 
                    would be an example of a consumer thread. In order to allow for multiple threads to access the 
                    same data, I needed to implement locks and make them thread safe. A thread would try to gain access
                    to a particle and if the particle was already in use by another thread, it would wait until the 
                    particle was released from the other thread and when it was released it would try to gain access to
                    the particle again. 

                    <div class="font-size-to-window-size" style="margin-top: 10px;">There is an output BMP image for an output image for the simulation which shows the 
                        piece of paper that the particles hit. The particles have a random angle at which they are 
                        sprayed out of the can in order to randomly hit the paper much like a real spray can would 
                        spray.
