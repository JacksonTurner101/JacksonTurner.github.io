        <p>This game was created for a game jam were the theme for the jam was "chains" and the game had to be made within
            the 2 day time window. In this game project there were 
            three people contributing to the development. There was me, the game designer, programmer and lead for the project.
            And the other 2 made the graphics and audio for the game. This project taught me a alot about managing and leading a
            project. For the entire duration of the project it was on my shoulders to not only program the game and its systems, 
            but to also direct the team in a coordinated fashion in order to meet a deadline. At the end of the short 2 day time 
            window for the development of the game, a playable demo was released on time.
