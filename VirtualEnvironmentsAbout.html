        <img id="geGif" src="Gifs/VirtualEnvironments.gif">
        <p>The aim of this project was to find out if distance perception was affected by multiple factors like
            texture detail and other visual ques in virtual reality. To conduct this experiment my team and I 
            created three environements of varying detail. Low, medium and high detail. These "details" included 
            things like quality of the textures, lighting and objects used in the environments.
             While the participant was in the virtual world, they would see a ball placed in the 
            environment. The ball would be set at different distances and the participant would have to try and
            acuaratley guess the correct distance.

        <ul>
            <li>I created all the environments in unity</li>
            <li>I collected the data by using an oculus rift</li>
            <li>I analyzed the data me and my team collected by T-testinf the results</li>
