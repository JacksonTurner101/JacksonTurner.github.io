        <img id="geGif" src="Gifs/VirtualEnvironments.gif">
        <p class="font-size-to-window-size">The aim of this case study was to find out if distance perception was affected by multiple factors like
            texture detail and other visual ques in virtual reality. To conduct this experiment my team and I 
            created three environements of varying detail. Low, medium and high detail. These "details" included 
            things like quality of the textures, lighting and objects used in the environments.
            While the participant was in the virtual world, they would see a ball placed in the 
            environment. The ball would be set at different distances and the participant would have to try and
            acuaratley guess the correct distance.

        <ul style="font-size: max(1vw,18px);">
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">I created all the environments in unity
                 <div style=" padding-left: 15px; font-weight: normal;">There are three environments with different levels of
                    "detail", which include the different textures, the lighting and objects in the scene.
                 </div>
            </li>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">I collected the data by using an oculus rift
                <div style=" padding-left: 15px; font-weight: normal;">The case study required a number of participants
                    to use an oculus rift to view the environments within virtual reality and estimate distances of an 
                    object that they could see. I would record these estimates which would later be used for data analysis.
                 </div>
            </li>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">I analyzed the data me and my team collected by T-Testing the results
                <div style=" padding-left: 15px; font-weight: normal;">I applied T-tests to compare participants' distance
                     estimates across the three different environments.
