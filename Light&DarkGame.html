            This game was made during a game jam with the theme being duality. This theme is present through the
            gameplay and visuals. In the game the player must jump through the level but everytime they jump, they 
            switch the world to the opposite colour. When the world switches, there are a new set of platforms
            available to the player. The colour of the world switches back to light and dark everytime the player
            jumps.

            The game was made within the 2 day period that the game jam allowed. At the end of the game jam, a 
            playable demo was available for download, showcasing the core gameplay features that incorparted 
            the game jam's theme of 'Duality'. The main feature showcased is the changing available platforms 
            each time the player jumps. This was my first time participating in a game jam, and it taught me 
            valuable lessons about time management, the behind-the-scenes process of game development, and how
            to handle unexpected challenges that arise during development.
